## 🧠 Project Overview

The primary goal of BilMeet is to help Bilkent students coordinate social and productive activities during their free hours between classes. Since checking availability manually can be time-consuming and inefficient, BilMeet automates this process by combining **schedule matching** with **interest compatibility**.

Users can create hangout requests by specifying time, location, duration, and activity type. Other users can view these requests, examine profiles and interests, and decide whether to accept or decline. The platform is exclusive to Bilkent students, encouraging a safer and more community-focused environment.
